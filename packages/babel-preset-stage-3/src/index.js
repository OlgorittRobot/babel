As of v7.0.0-beta.52, we've decided to remove
the official Babel Stage presets. You can find more information
at issue #7770: https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/7770, but
the TL;DR is that it's causing more harm than convenience in that
the preset is always out of date, each change is usually going to
require a major version bump and thus people will be behind,
and it encouraged too many people to opt-in to too many proposals
that they didn't intend to.

If you want the same configuration as before, you can use this configuration.

{
  "plugins": [
    "@babel/plugin-syntax-dynamic-import",
    "@babel/plugin-syntax-import-meta",
    ["@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties", { "loose": false }],
    "@babel/plugin-proposal-json-strings"
  ]
}

This will be the last publish of "@babel/preset-stage-3", and it won't be
in the final release.

If it's a hassle to maintain, you can certainly make your own preset to use
across projects, or there might be one in the community to use.
